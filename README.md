# WhatsApp-Analysis

This piece of code gives you the possibility to analyze your WhatsApp data from specific chats. This is just a base version so it doesn't do complex analysis yet but still gives you interessting insights about questions like who sents the most messages in the group, when is the group the most active, who sents the most media etc. 

To use the code export the chat data from WhatsApp to a txt file. Before using the code you have two adapt one or two minor things that are country specific, e.g how your WhatsApp saves dates and times and what words are used as placeholder for media that are not part of the export. Besides that, the code should work fine for you as well.
